# Construction info

* Laser cut the dxf out first. Make sure the red lines on the Front Finish and all the text is only etched!
* Wood glue the Lower and Upper Electronic Base together. Use a pin or a screw through the 2 aligning holes to get correct position. Use clamp or masking tape for good adhesion. Remove screws/pins when dry.
* Wood glue Base and Base Lip together. Use a pin or a screw through the aligning holes to get correct position. Use 6-10mm staples and a staple gun for  quicker assembly. Use staples in places you won't see them when finished (i.e. on the inside of the extracticon). Remove screws/pins.
* Countersink the 4 larger holes in Lower Electronics Base. Screw the completed Electronics Base to the Base Lip.
* Glue the castellations between Sides into the Base together. Adhesion can be aided by sanding or scraping of any blackened charred wood between joints to be glued. Use 6-10mm staples and a staple gun for  quicker assembly. Use staples in places you won't see them when finished (i.e. on the base)
* Glue the castellations between Socket Base and Sides together. Adhesion can be aided by sanding or scraping of any blackened charred wood between joints to be glued. Use 6-10mm staples and a staple gun for  quicker assembly. Use staples in places you won't see them when finished (i.e. on the Socket Base)
